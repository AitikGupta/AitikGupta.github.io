#### E-RotaNet is a Computer Vision pipeline, which can rotate images in proportion to human-level vision.
## What is 'E' in E-Rotanet?
'E' stands for the Efficientnet backbone used to learn the features and the context of the images.<br>
> EfficientNets are a family of image classification models which use compound scaling, and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, yet being an order-of-magnitude smaller and faster than previous models.

## About the dataset
[The released models](https://github.com/aitikgupta/E-RotaNet/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha) are trained on [Google Street View](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/GMCP_Geolocalization/) dataset, which contains ~62k images which contain mostly human-perception viewing angles of streets and buildings.
## Documentation
Documentation can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/aitikgupta/E-RotaNet).
## Screenshots
The bare source code can rotate images and generate a plot like this:

However, [the repository](https://github.com/aitikgupta/E-RotaNet) also contains a deployed Flask application, such that it attains following proof of concept:
