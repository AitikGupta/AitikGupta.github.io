description: A narration of 3 pivotal decisions in my tech-journey
---

**I'm Aitik, and this is me reflecting on some incredible chapters of my life.**
<hr>

<ins>***This blog is a narration of 3 pivotal decisions I've made in my formative years that shaped my core***</ins>.

To get your attention, here's a list of companies/programs that I've interned at in during my university time (all off-campus):
- Headout (2023)
- BharatX (2023)
- Mercari (2022)
- Swiggy (2022)
- FamPay (2021)
- Retrera (2021)
- Google Summer of Code (2021)
- Major League Hacking (2021)
- RapidQuest (2020)
- Defence Research & Development Organisation (2019)

> *I'll take you through a journey starting with having nothing to add on my resume, to deleting experiences so that I can fit everything on a single page.*

## Pre-University Era
I did my schooling from Delhi.. which at the time used to have a state-quota of *80% seats*.

So with my decent-*ish* rank, I had options to choose from some premier instituitions: **Delhi Technological University** (*DTU*), **Netaji Subhas University of Technology** (*NSUT*), **Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology** (*IIIT-Delhi*), among other colleges through *JAC* (Joint Admission Committee), Delhi.

I however did something else entirely, <ins>***which did not pass muster with a lot of people***</ins>.
### First Pivotal Decision
By and through the counselling time, I had realised something important about myself. Up till this point, the *only awareness* I had was on my academic (*and a few off-beat*) pursuits, which left my <ins>**personal skills largely uncharted**</ins>.

Sure, I'd participated in a few school events.. but it wasn't nearly enough "co-curricular"..
> Akin to fleeting touch of water on your fingertips.. instead of an immersive plunge I feel it really should have been?

In this wave of self-awareness, figuring out the gaping holes in my "***wisdom***".. a chain of thoughts led me to the first pivotal decision to shape my core:

> <ins>***I decided to move away from Delhi, and my comfort zone with it***</ins>.

I might've been inspired from **Siddhartha Gautama's story**.. now that I look back at it. But as long as I was in my comfort zone I *would've never understood what I never knew*.

And that is why I went ahead with All India (JoSAA) counselling, instead of Delhi's JAC board.. and eventually ended up at ***Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior***.

## First Year: all fun and games
As I stepped on this new path of self-discovery, my immediate focus shifted toward honing my communication skills - both verbal and written - <ins>**developing the confidence to express myself openly**</ins>.
> So I actively engaged in a *lot* of events, clubs and extracurricular activities.

A few months later, I acted out Mark Antony's "***Friends, Romans, Countrymen***" speech (embedded it in my memories from school) on a stage, entitling me to Mr. Parichay (Or Mr. Fresher, as some dialects dictate).

^This was the beginning of two semesters full of participating/organising/part-timing as a pet owner (long story).

	<figcaption>^The "long story"</figcaption>
</p>

> All this virtually left no time for any technical development.. ***or so I thought***.

Sure, me and some of my friends occassionally used to solve ***one or two coding problems*** ~ slowly building up an ego blanket of being <ins>**5 star coders on Hackerrank**</ins> 😜, then blaming the myriad of to-be-learnt topics when we <ins>***couldn't solve two oots of problems***</ins> in a competitive setting.

I used to look at other masters of coding in my batch and feel the *impostor syndrome* kicking in (I had CS in +2) ~ but then **waves of procrastination** used to take away my zeal, and I'd anyways <ins>**always have something to fill my time up with**</ins>.

### Second Pivotal Decision
All this built up profound unawareness came crashing, as I ended my first year with no solid technical improvements ~ this was time for the second pivotal decision that shaped my core.

> <ins>***Determined to reach a technological epiphany, I decided to completely remove Windows from my potato PC, and embraced Linux as my one and only.***</ins>

Now this might not sound like a "pivotal" decision to the reader.. but as I reflect on it while penning down this blog, I can't help but break into a Cheshire cat's grin.. having confidence that **this small decision had a huge impact on my core**. How?

> It taught me *how* to struggle my way through problems, especially when there's no one around to help you.

I kid you not, there had been countless nights of me stomping my head on my own laptop to get the *bluetooth module* working, for example. 😂

## Second Year: machine learning prologue
My roommate from first year had this newfangled interest in Machine Learning by the end-semester summer holidays, at the time:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996118/274632108-fc0714c1-ad95-4cc1-b4d3-8fb27b548344.gif" alt="BlackCatZoningOut" width="40%" />
	<figcaption>^1st year</figcaption>
</p>

I had ample amount of time by this point, as I decided to remove myself from some organisations / clubs / activities.
> Except the **dramatics** and a **techno-managerial** forum (both endowed me the best mentors I've had) 💫

So I really took my friend's advice when he said:
> "Deep Learning ke courses karle, usme Machine Learning bhi seekh jayega."
> 
> (Do Deep Learning courses, they'll teach you Machine Learning as well)

<ins>**This was downright one of the worst advices I've ever been given that I'd religiously followed**</ins>.

(If you do not count Engineering in itself 😉 ~ jk)

<hr>

So I started these deep learning courses, which showed me all these gorgeous graphics for linear regression 🥰... <ins>***but then started with Reinforcement learning/Generative models***</ins> 💀??!

Obiously, things started shoo'ing over.. I realised I needed some mathematical foundations before all this.. so I started all over in my 3rd semester with Andrew Ng's courses, and learning Python from the very basics.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996118/274760154-a06c1266-8858-4e2f-b667-4158fe4a786f.png" alt="MachineLearningAndrewNg" width="50%" />

</p>

### Internship: Healthcare (first one with a salary)
Before I move ahead with the story, I'd like to quickly mention the time I did an *unpaid internship* at DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) during the summer vacations at the end of my 1st year in Delhi.

So I empathise with juniors who come up to me ask should they consider doing an unpaid internship too:
"***..but in these times? hell naw kid***".

<hr>

Jumping back to a year later.. by the end of my 2nd year I got an opportunity to <ins>work with a team in Boston</ins> around their virtual physical rehabilitation application using Machine Learning.
> Specifically, ***Human Pose Estimation***. (read about HPE, interesting concept)

<ins>***This was my first internship with a stipend***</ins> ~ was paid in some peanuts.

> Most of my work involved around <ins>fixing/improving a subpar C++ codebase</ins> that handled the heavy lifting (inferencing through a human-pose-estimation model), intended to run on both iOS and Android.

	<figcaption>One of the side-projects (any action -> any model), which obviously never made it across localhost (you can see why 😂)</figcaption>
</p>

One eventuality from this internship was that it made me weigh up so many research papers, it ignited my research interest, too. (<ins>***only to be crushed later***</ins> ~ read further)

## Third Year: machine learning epilogue
I shared this cool application of HPE with a friend (also interested in data side of ML).. and without skipping a beat we dove into experimenting & writing ***our own research paper***. Surprisingly, it <ins>got accepted at a conference</ins> and is now up on the ACM digital library:

- [ActiveNet: A computer-vision based approach to determine lethargy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430984.3430986)

	<figcaption>This was half the fun, sorry <a href="https://aaditagarwal.in/">Aadit</a> 😂</figcaption>
</p>

With me choosing to end that machine learning internship (and **the full-time role they were willing to offer alongside college**), I went through another round of self-awareness epiphany.. which led me to the third pivotal decision to shape my core.

### Third Pivotal Decision
On a deeper self-retrospective, I cognized that during my "machine learning" internship I was more excited about the <ins>**practical improvements**</ins> (fixing haywire of pointers/memory leaks/logical flaws) I made to the source code.. than the ***research/theoretical*** part of it.

Moreover, from an applied engineering perspective, trying to find a job in this landscape ***without a decent research background or interest*** was (and is) tough.

> <ins>***Given this line of reasoning, I decided to put an end to my short stint of machine learning jouney and switch to a traditional software engineering path.***</ins>

What do I mean by a "software engineering" path?
I started low-level **code-contributions to open-source libraries** I usually used at that time:
- NumPy ([contributions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta))
- Matplotlib ([contributions](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta))
- OpenCV ([contributions](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta)) / etc.

..which later helped me during my Google Summer of Code, but we'll get to that in a bit.

### Fellowship: MLH (food for resume)
A lot of times people demand **genuity** in projects, and usually scorn at template projects (that's right, looking at you, <ins>***TO-DO List in React***</ins>). While template projects have their merits, they tend to simply pale in comparison to the ***fiercely competitive landscape***.

Most of my batchmates/seniors/juniors used to follow the trend of learning **MERN stack** to dive deeper in backend/frontend paradigms. I however don't share the same journey as them.. coming from a **Python/C++** background, I decided to stick with those languages to plunge into <ins>backend</ins>.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996118/276809971-11a418dd-a095-4ce4-8f78-2ff3ad09ad2a.png" alt="MLHFellowship" width="80%" />
	<figcaption>My MLH pod</figcaption>
</p>

This fellowship was in January '21 (6th semester), and with lockdown imposed I had ***exorbitant amounts of time*** ~ contributing to open source, figuring out the "*Data Structures & Algorithms*" part of my journey, etc.
> ***I never explored DSA in depth before the end of my 3rd year.***

During this MLH Fellowship, I learnt two soft skills.. how to:
1. communicate in a team consisting of people from all around the world
2. work in all the timezones that *can* exist 😭


<ins>***Only the projects that I worked on during this fellowship exist on my resume***</ins> (as of today, the time of writing this). I wrote [blogs](https://aitikgupta.com/projects/) about them, ofcourse.. a habit I highly ***procrastinate-yet-love***.

## Fourth Year: everything, at one place, all at once
### Open-Source: GSoC
This was during the summer holidays (*as if that mattered during lockdown*) at the end of my 3rd year.

A generic day used to look like this:
- I played games (Valorant/GTA 5/Far Cry 3-4-5/Rocket League/FIFA 18 career mode/you name it)
- I watched movies/series and abounding animes (completed Naruto/FMA/FMAB/you name it)
- I ate/slept whenever I wanted (which timezone? you name it)

...
- I solved Leetcode problems (a few a day)
- I prepared for interviews (landed me an internship just after completing GSoC)
- and I dedicatedly contributed to open source (Google Summer of Code project)

> <ins>**My theory was simple**</ins>: stay enough time on your PC, and there's ***bound*** to be a productive time when some ***10 minutes are worth 10 long hours***)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996118/276809872-57e10b42-7fd8-428c-8f69-e2316acf52cd.png" alt="MatplotlibWeekly" width="80%" />
	<figcaption>Matplotlib dev team, amazing people ✨</figcaption>
</p>

<hr>
This *<ins>will probably hurt a lot of influencers' opinions</ins>*, but I ***needed*** data structures and memoised recursions for my work at Matplotlib during GSoC. 😆
### Internship: B2B Travel industry
While my GSoC project involved some low-level programming (details in my other [blogs](https://aitikgupta.com/tags/#gsoc)), my immediate next internship involved working with ***highly abstracted frameworks*** such as Flask/MongoDB/GraphQL with a very-early team based in **San Francisco** for a ***retreat-planning software***.
> GSoC community helped me here, to get in touch with them.

<p align="center">

	<figcaption>Small team, great culture ⭐</figcaption>
</p>

Since I was dealing in dollars this time, this internship is when I made <ins>***max bucks with half as much pressure***</ins> compared to Indian firms.

### Internship: FinTech
I interviewed with FamPay (*applied directly, without a referral*).. just as my previous internship ended.

> The next few months of FinTech experience was when I really started understanding how real life applied software engineering works at noticeable scale.

Some takeaway learnings:
- How transactions are modelled
- How does a reward engine work
- How to A/B test based on Cohorts
- How is a Test-Driven-Development (TDD) framework implemented
- .. and most importantly, ***How <ins>not</ins> to intoxicate myself like a maniac in a company's off-site*** 😵‍💫

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43996118/276833386-d023dd65-9ed4-471c-b38a-7267c2394ebd.gif" alt="FamPayOffSite" width="50%" />
	<figcaption>Me after:</figcaption>
</p>

With the conclusion of this internship, I finally felt that feeling of self-reliance (very rare these days).. that I probably won't go jobless when I graduate.
> This was an optimistic hunch, I never knew placements for 2023 batch <ins>***will be godawful***</ins>.

### Internship: FoodTech
Cut short a few months, I applied to SuprDaily (a Swiggy acquisition) for a software engineering internship position.. ***this time with a referral***.
> The entire concept of internship hunt had started becoming gruelling, now that <ins>***OaaS was becoming popular***</ins>.
> 
> ([Section](https://aitikgupta.com/mercari-japan/#the-daunting-job-description) of my previous blog, for context)

Most of this internship revolved around building Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for *real-time demand shaping* based on **Go** services (my first interaction ever with this language).

Some takeaway learnings:
- How a warehouse management system is designed
- How last mile delivery logistics work
- .. and most importantly, ***How <ins>not</ins> to manage internship while performing college duties*** (bye-bye lockdown 👋)

## Fifth year: emotional maturity
As my fifth and final year began, I started gaining clarity of what the upcoming months and quarters had in store for me.
### Internship: C2C (abroad)
When the internship at SuprDaily ended, I received a summer internship offer from Mercari JP.
> The complete interview and relocation process is documented [here](https://aitikgupta.com/mercari-japan).

And so, after a ***long set of walks*** around the academic/administration/stationary to get NOC, I travelled to Japan.. solo.

Speaking of solo, here's a list of random spontaneous things I regularly engaged in:
- Made ready-to-eat food (and burnt my hands, still)
- Ate like a chimp
- Got stopped by police (2 times)
- Travelled far to get free tickets to an amusement park on my birthday
- Got mistaken for a beggar, with no internet to translate languages
- Laughed and cried at miniscule things

<p align="center">

	<figcaption>First "on-site" internship.. some crazy learnings, and some better off not-documented 😂</figcaption>
</p>

### Internship: FinTech (credit)
A couple months after I came back to India, I interviewed with this Bangalore-based startup offering *crazy* benefits. (It was my last semester, so I was allowed to go on-site again)

I had some **amazing ownership** at BharatX as an intern, where I developed ***real-time fraud prevention services*** from the get-go.
> Even though the exposure to the startup ecosystem & monetary benefits were immense, I felt **"too much" ownership** at this early stage of my career was like a *double-edged sword*.

Why?
- I applied my existing knowledge to engineer services
- My attempts to learn independently in such high-pressure environment proved to be ineffective

Those few months in Bangalore made me endure <ins>some great lows and highs</ins>, enough for me to make some pivotal decisions (***fully envisioning it documented if I was writing this article a few years down the line***).

I left after a few months, not primarily because of these reasons, but ***mostly due to my personal reasons***.

### Internship: B2C Travel industry
Headout was the icing on the cake of my college internship journey - it was just what I needed at that point.

> I applied via internal referral and joined their booking-management (backend) team in April '23.

*With absolutely brilliant engineers around me*, I had an exhilarating time there.  Some key takeaways this time:
- Importance of good mentors (more on this later)
- Importance of effective oratory skills and strong experiences
- .. and most importantly, **how to read/see-through verbal/non-verbal corporate language** 🙃

## Post-University Era
After five years of a rollercoaster career journey, it was about time I jotted down some of the minute parts (mostly tech-related).. making sure not to mention countless ***non-academic escapades*** - some are probably better off reserved for me.. and some to my friends (BH-1 supremacy). 😝

> <ins>***I joined Mercari as a full-time employee in October '23***</ins>.. around the same time I'm writing this tenth-rate of a blog.

## Ending notes
With what I've seen and experienced, here's some generic software-engineering things I feel might be relevant:
### Investing time
This is one of the most important learnings a lot of people miss out on.. ***there's no "enough-time" to master things in software engineering***.

> ***It's like a scoop of honey which you can't just lick once (and immediately know-it-all).. <ins>it gets thicker and sweeter as you spend time stirring it</ins>.***

^This is how I now define "backend" to people.. might be true for a whole lot of other concepts, too.

### Importance of (good) mentors
Looking back to whatever short amount of time I *can* look back at, I'd credit a lot to the amazing mentors I've had along the way. 🙇🏻

I was helped out with:
- General clarity of thoughts
- Logical treading around problem statements
- Importance of introspection time-to-time
- Opportunities to go bold, on my own 🔥

Here's a piece of advice if you're someone in your formative years:
> ***While a good mentor can undoubtedly propel you far on journey, don't forget that <ins>your own efforts and groundwork</ins> play an equally crucial role in shaping you.***

### Importance of struggle
**<ins>I have utmost respect for the concept of struggle</ins>**. I strongly believe it adds value to your life *regardless of the result*, directly or indirectly.

You may not be very bright, you may not possess natural skills (personal attacc).. ***but if given enough time***, your hard-smart-work will always get you either:
- Spectacular results
- Or a granular understanding of what you're doing
	- to-be-used in another opportunity ✨

<hr>

<ins>**I hope this adds value to your life, reader**</ins>.

I'm off-to new experiences ~ and I wish the same for you. ❤️
