<h2 align="center"> Hello, I'm Aitik Gupta. </h2>
An undergraduate in my junior year from Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior.
> * _MLH Fellow Spring'21_ at <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="http://fellowship.mlh.io/">Major League Hacking</a>

With a keen interest in __open-source__, I frequently contribute to organisations based on __computational Python__.

I like to think along the lines of clean and object-oriented code, mostly using __Python__ and __C++__. My interests lie in the field of __Software Engineering__ with __Machine Learning__, _but I'm always up for new and exciting challenges!_

My personal projects apply technologies including Machine Learning, Computer Vision etc. to realtime utilities, and are open-sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/aitikgupta).

Although most of the code I've contributed is proprietary, I find _Open Source community_ truly amazing, some of my major contributions:
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta+)
* [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta+)
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta+)
* [Pitivi](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&author_username=aitikgupta)
* [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues?q=author%3Aaitikgupta+)

Apart from the technical aspects, when I'm not on my laptop I like to take part in stage & street theatres, and attend to gaming on E-Platforms!
